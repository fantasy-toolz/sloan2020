# SLOAN 2020
## Predictive error estimates for baseball statistics using clustering algorithms and covariance analysis
### Michael Petersen and Erich Rentz (@FantasyToolz)

### Description
The repository for public tools to generate MLB predictions using the k-means clustering technique presented by Petersen & Rentz 2020.

There are three primary notebooks:
1. **Generate-Clusters** Create clusters of similar players and make future projections
2. **Validate-Predictions** Compare projections with real data
3. **Model-Tuning** Examine the models to make decisions on parameters

### TODO
1. Add Windows compability
2. Change scraper to MLB.com scraper for using pure public data
3. Break .py files into a package which installs (i.e. add a __init__.py and installer)
4. Update definition structure into classes
5. Homogenise pitching and hitting to be same definitions
6. VERIFICATION
